features to future:
- add snackbar
- change logic from "user.login.uuid" to normal "user.id" (because sometime "user.id.value" is empty that is not good, I think)
- add more better empty states and loading logic
- refactor logic to load weather via redux
- add isDevelopment prop to envs, which should enable/disabled redux logs middleware
- debug double extract of users in users page on first load
